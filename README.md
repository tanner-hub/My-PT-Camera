# My-PT-Camera
> In my expirimentation with Amcrest PTZ cameras and Python development, I have discoverd these systems are extreamly unrelaible to manipulate. In order to continue my image/motion recognization experiments, I built my own PT camera using a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 Wifi running a debian server, openCV, Flask, and Motion.

> Additionally I have written a java application that allows a user to manipulate, view, and control this camera over the network.

> After I resolve some bugs and consoidate my code base, I will post my code here for the community.
